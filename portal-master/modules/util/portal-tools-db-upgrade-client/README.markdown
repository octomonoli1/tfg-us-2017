# DB Upgrade Client

The DB Upgrade Client is a standalone client used for upgrading your Liferay DXP
database.

## Installation

To install and execute the DB Upgrade Client, there are two methods you can
follow.

### Extracting the Downloaded ZIP

1. Deploy Liferay to an application server.

2. Download the latest version of the DB Upgrade Client.

3. Unzip the client into your Liferay instance
   (e.g., `${liferayHome}/tools/portal-tools-db-upgrade-client`).

4. Run `java -jar com.liferay.portal.tools.db.upgrade.client.jar`.

### Using JPM

1. Install [JPM](https://jpm4j.org).

2. Run `jpm install com.liferay.portal.tools.db.upgrade.client`.

3. Run `liferay-upgrade-db`.

Both methods have separate ways of executing the tool. The command line options
listed in the next section, however, can be appended the same way for both
methods (e.g., `liferay-upgrade-db --noShell`).

## Usage

The first time you run the tool, it will automatically configure properties for
your installation of Liferay. You can also do this manually by configuring
`app-server.properties`, `portal-upgrade-database.properties`, and
`portal-upgrade-ext.properties`. Make sure to place these `.properties` files in
the same directory from which you execute the tool.

The DB Upgrade Client also connects to the Gogo shell automatically after the
upgrade if there were any issues. This lets you check the status of any module
upgrades that failed to complete.

**Note:** You can configure the portal to only upgrade the core, and not
external modules by adding a file called
`com.liferay.portal.upgrade.internal.configuration.ReleaseManagerConfiguration.cfg`
in the `osgi/configs/` folder with the property `autoUpgrade=false`.

You can reference options for command line execution, Gogo shell commands, and
