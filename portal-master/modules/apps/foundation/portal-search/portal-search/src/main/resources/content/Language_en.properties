include-inherited-permissions-help=Set this to true to include a user's inherited roles as part of search permission filtering. A user's inherited roles include all users assigned to a user from their user group and organization memberships.
index-commit-immediately-help=Set this to true to immediately commit search index write requests. Setting this to true may negatively impact search engine performance as each write request will force the search engine to refresh the index reader and potentially flush transactions to disk. The default behavior of the portal is to commit immediately for individual index operations (e.g. add blog, update blog) but delay commits for bulk operations (e.g. index all users, index all wikis) until all entries have been sent to the search engine. Setting this to false may cause portlets like Asset Publisher to exhibit a delayed response when showing newly added content. For example, users may experience a delay with the default Elasticsearch search engine. See https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/current/near-real-time.html for more information.
