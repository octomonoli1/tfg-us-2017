/**
 * Provides an interface that determines the type of entity that shall be
 * selected and information to return. The item selector uses the criterion to
 * display only the {@link ItemSelectorView} that can select that particular
 * entity type and that can support the {@link ItemSelectorReturnType}.
 *
 * <p>
 * Implementations of this interface can hold fine-grained details about
 * entities that can be selected. This detailed information should be specified
 * ideally using primitive types (or using very simple types that can be JSON
 * serialized). The implementation can set this data and make it accessible,
 * however desired. It must, however, specify a non-parametrized constructor.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * As an example, see the <a
 * href="https://github.com/liferay/liferay-portal/blob/7.0.x/modules/apps/collaboration/blogs/blogs-item-selector-api/src/main/java/com/liferay/blogs/item/selector/criterion/BlogsItemSelectorCriterion.java">BlogsItemSelectorCriterion</a>
