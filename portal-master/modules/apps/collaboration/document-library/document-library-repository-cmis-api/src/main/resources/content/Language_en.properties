delete.depth.description=Sets the depth of mapped CMIS entries to remove when a deletion is called from within the portal. The deeper the setting, the more calls to the server required. When a deletion is called from outside the portal, mapped CMIS entries remain stagnant in the database. Expected values are: -1 for deep, 0 for none, and 1 for shallow.
