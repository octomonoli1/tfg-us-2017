		<p>
			This package contains the interfaces exported by the
			<strong>document-library-repository-external</strong> framework to
			allow for third party implementation of external repositories for
			Liferay Portal.
		</p>

		<p>
			The best way to know how to use this framework is to look at an
			existing implementation (like Sharepoint or Google Drive external
			repositories), but the overall idea is explained below.
		</p>

		<p>
			When implementing an external repository, implementations must be
			provided for four main interfaces: <code>ExtRepository</code>,
			<code>ExtRepositoryFileEntry</code>,
			<code>ExtRepositoryFolder</code>, and
			<code>ExtRepositoryFileVersion</code>. <code>ExtRepository</code>
			is in charge of the communication between Liferay Portal and the
			back-end repositories. The latter three interfaces describe the
			objects stored in the back-end repository: folders, files, and
			versions.
		</p>

		<p>
			The classes implementing <code>ExtRepositoryFileEntry</code>,
			<code>ExtRepositoryFolder</code>, and
			<code>ExtRepositoryFileVersion</code> usually make a bridge between
			the methods of these interfaces and the methods in the back-end
			repository API. For instance, they may map Liferay's filename field
			to the back-end repository field holding the filename (example:
			field <code>ows_BaseName</code> in SharePoint).
		</p>

		<p>
			<code>ExtRepositoryFileEntry</code>,
			<code>ExtRepositoryFolder</code>, and
			<code>ExtRepositoryFileVersion</code> are inside a hierarchy where
			two more interfaces exist: <code>ExtRepositoryObject</code> and
			<code>ExtRepositoryModel</code>. <code>ExtRepositoryObject</code>
			defines the properties which files and folders have in common,
			while <code>ExtRepositoryModel</code> has properties which are
			common to all three main types: files, folders, and versions.
			Implementors are free to define their own class hierarchy to
			implement these interfaces, but are advised to create one abstract
			class for <code>ExtRepositoryObject</code> and another one for
			<code>ExtRepositoryModel</code> so that they can be extended by the
			implementations of <code>ExtRepositoryFileEntry</code>,
			<code>ExtRepositoryFolder</code>, and
			<code>ExtRepositoryFileVersion</code>. It should be noted that the
			abstract implementation of <code>ExtRepositoryObject</code> should
			extend the abstract implementation of
			<code>ExtRepositoryObject</code>, to be coherent.
		</p>

		<p>
			When implementing <code>ExtRepository</code>, all methods returning
			or receiving an <code>ExtRepositoryFileEntry</code>,
			<code>ExtRepositoryFolder</code>, and
			<code>ExtRepositoryFileVersion</code> must assume that even if the
			instances have the types of the interfaces, they, in reality, are
			implemented by the classes described in the previous paragraph.
			That is, if you are implementing a SharePoint external repository,
			you return <code>SharepointFileEntry</code> objects when called by
			Liferay, and Liferay will give you <code>SharepointFileEntry</code>
			instances as arguments to the methods.
		</p>

		<p>
			To finish with, all data interchanged between Liferay and the
			implementations is in the back-end repository native format. These
			include object keys and user names. Liferay automatically converts
			these keys and user names to Liferay's IDs and user names, possibly
			with the help of some methods defined in <code>ExtRepository</code>
			(for instance: <code>getLiferayUserName()</code> must map back-end
			repository user names to Liferay user names).
