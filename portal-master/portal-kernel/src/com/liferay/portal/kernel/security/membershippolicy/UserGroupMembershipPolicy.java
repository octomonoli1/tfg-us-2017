/**
 * Provides the User Group Membership Policy interface, allowing customization
 * of user membership regarding user groups.
 *
 * <p>
 * User Group Membership Policies define the user groups a user is allowed to be
 * a member of and the user groups the user must be a member of.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * An implementation may include any number of rules and actions to enforce
 * those rules. The implementation may include rules and actions like the
 * following:
 * </p>
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * If a user doesn't have the custom attribute A, he cannot be assigned to user
 * group B.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * If the user is added to user group A, he will automatically be added to user
 * group B.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * The user must have the Administrator Role in order to be added to user group
 * "Admin User Group".
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 * Liferay's core services invoke {@link #checkMembership(long[], long[],
 * long[])} to detect policy violations before adding the users to and removing
 * the users from the user groups. On passing the check, the service proceeds
 * with the changes and propagates appropriate related actions in the portal by
 * invoking {@link #propagateMembership(long[], long[], long[])}. On failing the
 * check, the service foregoes making the changes. For example, Liferay executes
 * this logic when adding and updating user groups, adding and removing users
 * with respect to user groups.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Liferay's UI calls the "is*" methods, such as {@link
 * #isMembershipAllowed(long, long)}, to determine appropriate options to
 * display to the user. For example, the UI calls {@link
 * #isMembershipAllowed(long, long)} to decide whether to enable the checkbox
 * for adding the user to the user group.
