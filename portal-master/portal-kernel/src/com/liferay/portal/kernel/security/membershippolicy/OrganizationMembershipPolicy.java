/**
 * Provides the Organization Membership Policy interface, allowing customization
 * of user membership regarding organizations and organization roles.
 *
 * <p>
 * Organization Membership Policies define the organizations a user is allowed
 * to be a member of, the organizations the user must be a member of, the
 * organization roles the user is allowed to be assigned, and the organization
 * roles the user must be assigned.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * An implementation may include any number of rules and actions to enforce
 * those rules. The implementation may include rules and actions like the
 * following:
 * </p>
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * If a user is a member of the organization he will automatically be a member
 * of all its child organizations.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * Only the members of the parent organization can become a member of this
 * organization.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * If a user doesn't have the custom attribute A, he cannot be assigned to
 * organization B.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * If the user is added to organization A, he will automatically be added to
 * organization B.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * The user must have the Administrator Role in order to be added to
 * organization "Admin Organization".
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * All users with the custom attribute A will automatically have the
 * organization role B.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * All the users with organization role A cannot have organization role B
 * (incompatible roles).
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 * Liferay's core services invoke {@link #checkMembership(long[], long[],
 * long[])} to detect policy violations before adding the users to and removing
 * the users from the organizations. On passing the check, the service proceeds
 * with the changes and propagates appropriate related actions in the portal by
 * invoking {@link #propagateMembership(long[], long[], long[])}. On failing the
 * check, the service foregoes making the changes. For example, Liferay executes
 * this logic when adding and updating organizations, adding and removing users
 * with respect to organizations, and adding and removing organization roles
 * with respect to users.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Liferay's UI calls the "is*" methods, such as {@link
 * #isMembershipAllowed(long, long)}, to determine appropriate options to
 * display to the user. For example, the UI calls {@link
 * #isMembershipAllowed(long, long)} to decide whether to enable the checkbox
 * for adding the user to the organization.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Liferay's core services call {@link #isMembershipProtected(PermissionChecker,
 * long, long)} and {@link #isRoleProtected(PermissionChecker, long, long,
 * long)} to protect user organization memberships and organization role
 * assignments, appropriately.
 * </p>
