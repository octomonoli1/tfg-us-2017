/**
 * Provides the Site Membership Policy interface, allowing customization of user
 * membership regarding sites and site roles.
 *
 * <p>
 * Site Membership Policies define the sites a user is allowed to be a member
 * of, the sites the user must be a member of, the site roles the user is
 * allowed to be assigned, and the site roles the user must be assigned.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * An implementation may include any number of rules and actions to enforce
 * those rules. The implementation may include rules and actions like the
 * following:
 * </p>
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * If a user is a member of the site he will automatically be a member of all
 * its child sites.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * Only the members of the parent site can become a member of this site.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * If a user doesn't have the custom attribute A, he cannot be assigned to site
 * B.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * If the user is added to site A, he will automatically be added to site B.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * The user must have the Administrator Role in order to be added to site "Admin
 * Site".
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * All users with the custom attribute A will automatically have the site
 * role B.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * All the users with site role A cannot have site role B (incompatible
 * roles).
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 * Liferay's core services invoke {@link #checkMembership(long[], long[],
 * long[])} to detect policy violations before adding the users to and removing
 * the users from the sites. On passing the check, the service proceeds with the
 * changes and propagates appropriate related actions in the portal by invoking
 * {@link #propagateMembership(long[], long[], long[])}. On failing the check,
 * the service foregoes making the changes. For example, Liferay executes this
 * logic when adding and updating sites, adding and removing users with respect
 * to sites, and adding and removing site roles with respect to users.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Liferay's UI calls the "is*" methods, such as {@link
 * #isMembershipAllowed(long, long)}, to determine appropriate options to
 * display to the user. For example, the UI calls {@link
 * #isMembershipAllowed(long, long)} to decide whether to display the "Join"
 * link to the user.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Liferay's core services call {@link #isMembershipProtected(PermissionChecker,
 * long, long)} and {@link #isRoleProtected(PermissionChecker, long, long,
 * long)} to protect user site memberships and site role assignments,
 * appropriately.
 * </p>
