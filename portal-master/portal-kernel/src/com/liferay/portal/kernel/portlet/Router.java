/**
 * Contains a list of the available routes and handles conversion of URLs to
 * parameter maps and vice versa.
 *
 * <p>
 * The priority of a route is based on when it was added to the router. The
 * first route has the highest priority and a URL path will always be matched
 * against it first. If the first route does not match, the second will be
 * tried, continuing until either a match is found or all the routes have been
 * tested.

 * When choosing the order in which to place a list of routes, the general rule
 * is to sort the routes from least general to most general. The simplest way of
 * determining the generality of a route is by counting the number of capturing
 * fragments in it.
