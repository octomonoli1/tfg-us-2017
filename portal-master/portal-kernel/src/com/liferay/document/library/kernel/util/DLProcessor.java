/**
 * Provides a common interface for all the processors of the document library.
 * All document library processors must implement this interface.
 *
 * A DLProcessor (processor) is responsible for extracting additional metadata
 * or assets from
 * a Documents and Media file entry. Here are a couple examples of such metadata
 * and assets:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * Metadata stored in JPEG images or video files.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * Images to use as previews for PDF or Word documents.
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * Processors can be defined as OSGi components. To do that, annotate your
 * processor and register it under the type <code>DLProcessor</code>:
 * <pre>
 * {@literal @}Component(service = DLProcessor.class)
 * public class MyDLProcessor implements DLProcessor {
 *
 * }
 * </pre>
 * Implementing classes are responsible for managing any storage required by the
 * generated resources and for providing access to any generated assets. See
 * current implementations for examples.
